# Await WS Dart

Simplify WebSockets by allowing you to await upon requests.

We do this by building on top of an existing WebSocket solution, not replacing it,
so you can still keep things exactly how you want, but with these simple requests on top.

This is only a client for the [Await WS Go](https://github.com/VolticFroogo/await-ws-go) package;
